# Welcome view content

This sample demonstrates how to implement welcome view content, which gets displayed in certain views whenever they are empty.

Run the sample and run `Close Workspace`. In the _no workspace_ window, go to the Explorer. You'll see the content contributed via the `package.json` declaration.

## Running the Sample

- Open this example in VS Code Insiders
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch`
- `F5` to start debugging
- Run the `Workspaces: Close Workspace` command
- Open the Explorer view
